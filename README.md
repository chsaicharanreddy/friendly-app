# MRITS-Integrated-Learning-Hub
 In this project, we created a comprehensive application catering to students' academic needs. The application facilitates easy access to subject-specific notes, reference links from YouTube, and recommended books for various subjects. Additionally, students can find valuable resources on websites to enhance their knowledge. The application also includes coding practice in Python, C-language, and Java, offering a practical approach to programming skills development. â€¢ Implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, the application provides a streamlined interface for students to navigate through subjects, receive study tips, and follow a structured roadmap to enhance their skills, offering a holistic resource for academic success.
